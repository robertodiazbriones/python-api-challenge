# python-api-challenge

Hello this is the **Python API Challenge** homework that corresponds to the 6th unit of the _Data Analisis bootcamp course_, on this homework we practiced whit python, pandas/matplotlib, jupyter notebook and request data thru API's, to answear some questions about weather conditions around the world and were are the best palces to take those well deserved vacations:palm_tree::ocean:.  

This challange has 2 parts:

## Part I: WeatherPy
On this part, we will be creating a Python script on jupyter notebook to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. To accomplish this, we will be utilizing a simple Python libraries, the OpenWeatherMap API, to create a representative model of weather conditions across world cities like Temperature, Humidity Cloudiness and Wind Speed.   

## Part II - VacationPy
All the data gathered from Part I will be displayed on a world map using jupyter-gmaps and the Google Places API, we will locate cities with weather conditions, then we will filtered our preferences to narrow posible destinations.  

Solutions to this homework are in corresponding folders.  

## What I learnt

On this homework had the chance to work with real world data that is requested to websites thru APIs, this "raw data" has to be polished or even rearranged to be able to run scripts on it and get the answers we are looking for, it is really important to have reliable/trustful sources of data to get the corrct answers.
